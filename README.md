# 2021-DesignOfMechanicalSystem
This is Design of Mechanical System repo for SES projects weekly meetings during the academic year 2021-2022.

# Mechanical Design Process
* Understand the requirements, i.e. understanding the purpose of design.
* Analyze and evaluate the Design Mechanism- Shortlist and analyze various possible mechanisms for the machine.
* Analysis of Forces and Design of Elements- Material analysis and selection.
* Creation of detailed Mechanical Drawings- e.g. using software such as Inventor.


## The Mechanical System below is a Shock Breaker designed using Autodesk Inventor.

## Free Body Diagram

Sprung mass is mass that is suspended by a carâ€™s suspension. This includes the body, chassis, engine, gearbox, seats, passengers, etc.
The unsprung mass of a vehicle is the mass of the suspension, wheels or tracks, and other components directly connected to them.

## Understanding Von Mises Stress
Von Mises stress is a value used to determine if a given material will yield or fracture. It is mostly used for ductile materials, such as metals. The von Mises yield criterion states that if the Von Mises stress of a material under load is equal or greater than the yield limit of the same material under simple tension then the material will yield. Von Mises stress only considers distortion energy (change in shape) and not dilatational energy (change in volume).

# 1st Principal Stress
![1st Principal Stress](https://github.com/JKUATSES/2021-DesignMechanicalSystem/blob/main/Stress%20Analysis%20Report/1st%20Principal%20Stress.png)

## Understanding 1st Principal Stress
The 1st principal stress gives you the value of stress that is normal to the plane in which the shear stress is zero. The 1st principal stress helps you understand the maximum tensile stress induced in the part due to the loading conditions.

# 3rd Principal Stress
![3rd Principal Stress](https://github.com/JKUATSES/2021-DesignMechanicalSystem/blob/main/Stress%20Analysis%20Report/3rd%20Principal%20Stress.png)

## Understanding 3rd Principal Stress
The 3rd principal stress acts normal to the plane in which shear stress is zero. It helps you understand the maximum compressive stress induced in the part due to the loading conditions.

# Safety Factor
![Safety Factor](https://github.com/JKUATSES/2021-DesignMechanicalSystem/blob/main/Stress%20Analysis%20Report/Safety%20Factor.png)

## Understanding Safety Factor
In engineering, a factor of safety (FoS), also known as (and used interchangeably with) safety factor (SF), expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load.
